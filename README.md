This Git COURSE is a trial of a big project. We wanted to build a central website which will allow students of BRAC University to review their faculties, request to swap sections at ease.
Many of us roam on facebook groups for a single review, most of the time the reviews are mixed/out of context. In this site, we will try to merge all the reviews and then make an actual review for the faculty.

Obviously we will store the student ID for verification purpose, but it will be anonymous and will never be released anywhere.

This is a very childish git and was built with help of Vercel AI.
